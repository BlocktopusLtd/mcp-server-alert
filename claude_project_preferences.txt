# Claude Project Preferences for mcp-server-alert

## File Editing Preferences
- When editing files, show ONLY the diff of changes (git diff format)
- Never output full file contents or complete methods
- Use the edit_file function which returns diffs automatically
- For new files, show the complete content once, then only diffs for subsequent edits

## Git Workflow
- Branch naming: Use prefixes (feature/, bugfix/, refactor/) + descriptive-name
- Create a feature branch at the start of each chat session
- Commit after EVERY interaction/prompt response
- Never commit directly to main/master

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <summary of change>

User request: <brief summary of what user asked>
Changes made: <what Claude did>
Files affected: <list of files>

Context: <any relevant technical details>
```

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

## Auto-Commit Behavior
- Commit immediately before passing control back to user
- Include conversation context in every commit message
- This creates an audit trail and rollback points
- Each commit represents one interaction/change request

## PR Process
- When feature is complete, create PR to main
- PR should squash all commits into one
- Include summary of all changes and conversations
- Add testing instructions

## Safety Practices
- Show diff preview before making changes
- Confirm current branch before edits
- Note commit hash for important checkpoints
- Test changes if test suite is available

## Project-Specific Context
- This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
- Provides alert/notification capabilities
- TypeScript-based implementation
- Integrates with Claude and other AI assistants

## Development Patterns
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Maintain MCP protocol compliance
- Consider async/await patterns for server operations
- Keep error handling robust

## Available MCP Servers
- filesystem: For file operations in C:/dev/mcp-server-alert
- git: For version control operations
- github: For PR creation and GitHub integration (when configured)

## Communication Style
- Be concise in responses
- Focus on diffs and changes, not full code listings
- Explain what changed and why
- Always mention which files are affected
